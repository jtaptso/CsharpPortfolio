# TODO LIST - Ultimate C# MAsterclass Assignement

## Overview
This console application is a simple manager of TODOs. Each TODO is simply a description of a thing to be done (for example,
"Order a cake for the birthday party"). Each description must be unique. TODOs can be added, removed, or listed.

## Main application workflow
When the application starts, it shall print:
Hello!
What do you want to do?
[S]ee all TODOs
[A]dd a TODO
[R]emove a TODO
[E]xit
The user must select one of the given S, A, R, E options. The selected option can be both uppercase or lowercase, so it doesn’t matter if the user types “S” or “s” - both should go to the “see all todos” case. The user can keep selecting different options until the option “[E]xit” is selected, which will close the application.

## Selecting an option by the user

## Option S,s - See all TODOs
A list of all TODOs shall be printed to the console, all prefixed with an index(starting with 1). For exemple, it could look like this:
1. Order a cake for the birthday party
2. Buy train tickets for the weekend
3. Take Lucky to the vet.
After the list of TODOs is printed, the application should print again "What do you want to do?" with all options.

## Option "A" - Add a TODO
After selecting this option, the application shall print: Enter the TODO description:
Then, the user must enter a unique, non-empty description of a TODO. Once it is done, the application prints:
TODO successfully added: [DESCRIPTION]

Where the DESCRIPTION should be the TODO description the user provided. A TODO shall be added to the collection of TODOs (it can be seen by selecting the “S - See all TODOs” option). After a TODOs is added, the application should print again “What do you want to do?” with all available options.

## Option "R" - Remove a TODO
After selecting this option, the app should ask: 
Select the index of the TODO you want to remove:
Then, the list of all TODOs shall be printed, similarly as described for the “S - See all TODOs” option. If there are no TODOs yet, the program should print: No TODOs have been added yet.
The user should select a correct index from the given list (please notice that this list is indexed from 1, so when the user selects “1,” the first TODO from this list should be removed). After the correct index is selected, the TODO should be removed, which means it will no longer be shown when the S - See all TODOs option is selected. Then, the following message is printed:
TODO removed: [DESCRIPTION] 
…where the DESCRIPTION is the description of the TODO that has just been removed. Then the application should print again “What do you want to do?” with all available options.
